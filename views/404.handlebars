    <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, While I websurfed, weak and weary, Over many a
      strange and spurious website of hot chicks galore,</p>

      <p>While I clicked my fav'rite bookmark, Suddenly there came a warning, And my heart was filled with mourning,
      Mourning for my dear amour.</p>

      <p>'Tis not possible!, I pleaded, But my browser, so conceited, Remained blank, I then repeated, Just a blank and
      nothing more.</p>

      <p>With a scream, I was defeated, For my cookies were deleted, So i begged, no longer seated, "Give me back my free
      hardcore!"
</p>
      <p>Then, in answer to my query, Through the net I loved so dearly, Came its answer, dark and dreary: Quoth the
      server, 404.  </p>
